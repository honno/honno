I'm Matthew, a software engineer based in the UK. You might know me for...

- 🏢 Interning [@Quansight-Labs](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs) to create [testing tools](https://github.com/honno/hypothesis-array-api) for [Array API](https://data-apis.org/blog/array_api_standard_release/) adopters
- 🐍 Using Python for pretty much everything
- 🎲 Testing random numbers with my [prngtest](https://github.com/honno/prngtest) suite (previously [coinflip](https://github.com/honno/coinflip))
- 🐛 Taking a TDD-[ish](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1424457164001669122) approach when writing code, employing [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) and  [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/)
- 🏛 Bringing back lost media back to the public with [yygarchive.org](https://www.yygarchive.org)
